# Test Suite Summary - Aave Savings Integration

## Overview
Complete test coverage for the Saiv platform's savings functionality with Aave yield generation, covering both personal and group savings flows.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `tests/savings/personalSavings.test.js`
Tests for personal savings with Aave integration.

**Test Suites:**
- **POST /api/savings/wallet/deposit** - Deposit to Savings Wallet and Auto-Supply to Aave
  - ✅ Deposit ETH to savings wallet and automatically supply to Aave
  - ✅ Create new Savings record if none exists
  - ✅ Update existing Savings record on subsequent deposits
  - ✅ Return 400 for invalid amount
  - ✅ Return 400 for zero amount
  - ✅ Return 401 for unauthenticated request

- **GET /api/savings/aave/yield** - Get Aave Yield Information
  - ✅ Return Aave yield information for user savings
  - ✅ Filter by savings type (personal/group)
  - ✅ Return empty array if no Aave positions exist

**Key Validations:**
- Transfer from main wallet → savings wallet completes
- Aave supply is automatically triggered
- Savings record is created/updated with aavePosition
- aTokenBalance is tracked correctly
- Yield is calculated (aTokenBalance - suppliedAmount)
- Supply transactions are recorded

---

### 2. `tests/savings/groupSavings.test.js`
Tests for group savings with Aave integration.

**Test Suites:**
- **POST /api/groups/:groupId/contribute** - Contribute ETH to Group
  - ✅ Contribute ETH from user main wallet to group pool
  - ✅ Update payment window with contribution
  - ✅ Accumulate multiple contributions from same user
  - ✅ Return 400 for invalid amount
  - ✅ Return 401 for unauthenticated request

- **POST /api/groups/:groupId/contribute-token** - Contribute ERC20 Token to Group
  - ✅ Contribute ERC20 token from user main wallet to group pool
  - ✅ Update payment window with token contribution
  - ✅ Return 400 for missing token address

- **POST /api/groups/:groupId/windows/:windowNumber/complete** - Complete Payment Window and Auto-Supply to Aave
  - ✅ Complete payment window and automatically supply to Aave
  - ✅ Create Savings record with Aave position after window completion
  - ✅ Update existing Savings record on subsequent window completions
  - ✅ Handle ERC20 token supply to Aave
  - ✅ Return 400 if window is already completed
  - ✅ Skip Aave supply if no contributions were made

- **GET /api/savings/aave/yield?type=group** - Get Aave Yield for Group Savings
  - ✅ Return Aave yield information for group savings
  - ✅ Return empty array if no group Aave positions exist

**Key Validations:**
- Contributions from multiple members are tracked
- Payment window completion triggers Aave supply
- Total contributions are correctly calculated
- Savings record is created/updated with Aave position
- Works with both ETH and ERC20 tokens
- Yield tracking for group savings

---

### 3. `tests/integration/savingsFlow.test.js`
End-to-end integration tests for complete savings flows.

**Test Suites:**
- **End-to-End Personal Savings Flow**
  - ✅ Complete full personal savings flow: deposit → transfer → Aave supply → yield tracking
  - ✅ Complete full personal savings flow with ERC20 token (USDC)

- **End-to-End Group Savings Flow**
  - ✅ Complete full group savings flow: contributions → window completion → Aave supply → yield tracking
  - ✅ Complete full group savings flow with multiple payment windows
  - ✅ Complete full group savings flow with ERC20 token (USDC)

- **Mixed Personal and Group Savings Flow**
  - ✅ Handle both personal and group savings with Aave yield tracking
  - ✅ Correctly filter yield by type (personal vs group)

**Key Validations:**
- Complete user journey from deposit to yield tracking
- Multiple deposits/contributions accumulate correctly
- Both ETH and ERC20 tokens are supported throughout
- Aave supply is triggered at correct points
- Yield tracking works for all savings types
- Summary data is calculated correctly
- Multiple payment windows work correctly

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

### ✅ Personal Savings Flow
1. User deposits to savings wallet
2. Transfer from main wallet → savings wallet
3. Automatic supply to Aave
4. Savings record creation/update
5. Aave position tracking
6. Yield calculation and tracking

### ✅ Group Savings Flow
1. Members contribute to group pool (ETH and ERC20)
2. Contributions tracked in payment window
3. Payment window completion
4. Automatic supply to Aave
5. Group savings record creation/update
6. Aave position tracking
7. Yield calculation and tracking

### ✅ API Endpoints
- `POST /api/savings/wallet/deposit`
- `POST /api/groups/:groupId/contribute`
- `POST /api/groups/:groupId/contribute-token`
- `POST /api/groups/:groupId/windows/:windowNumber/complete`
- `GET /api/savings/aave/yield`

### ✅ Edge Cases
- Invalid amounts
- Zero amounts
- Unauthenticated requests
- Empty Aave positions
- Multiple deposits/contributions
- Multiple payment windows
- Already completed windows
- Zero contributions

### ✅ Smart Contract Integration
- Transfer functions called correctly
- Aave supply functions called with correct parameters
- Both ETH (address(0)) and ERC20 tokens supported
- Gas paid by backend wallet

## Mock Behavior

The mocked services simulate:

### aaveService
- `supplyPersonalSavingsToAave()` - Returns success with mock transaction hash and aToken balance
- `supplyGroupPoolToAave()` - Returns success with mock transaction hash and aToken balance
- `getATokenBalance()` - Returns principal + 2% yield
- `getAaveYield()` - Returns 2% of supplied amount

### contractService
- `callGroupPoolFunction()` - Returns mock transaction hash

This ensures tests verify the flow logic without requiring actual blockchain connections.

## Notes

- Tests use MongoDB test database (cleared after each test)
- JWT authentication is mocked
- All blockchain interactions are mocked
- Tests run in band (sequentially) to avoid database conflicts
- 30-second timeout for longer operations
